# Game Boy Amenizer ROM Sample Replacer

A small Python Flask web app that takes a `.raw` audio sample, applies a 4-bit conversion, and injects it into the first 16 KB of an existing Game Boy ROM (`amenizer.gb`). The result is a new `.gb` file ready to flash to your Game Boy for custom audio samples.

- **4-bit conversion**: Downsamples each byte to its upper 4 bits.
- **ROM injection**: Overwrites the first 16 KB of `amenizer.gb` with your converted data.
- **File size guard**: Rejects files over 512 KB to prevent excessive uploads.
